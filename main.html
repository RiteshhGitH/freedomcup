            showcase the true spirit of sportsmanship, have fun and learn from each other. Be there on 13th to be a
            part of an exhilarating football experience like ever before.

            Their audiences and fans have longstanding and deeply-rooted allegiances. Brands involved in sponsorship
            activation have the opportunity to come into contact with their fan base and enjoy the resulting commercial
            benefits. The more the fan base of your ideal target is close to the fan base of the team sponsor, the
            greater the return on investments. More often the audience sees your brand, the more they will get familiar
            with it and will tend to associate it with the sport they love and follow. This offers you the great chance
            of joining the conversation, providing significant information to the fans, building a large database, and
            having a direct relationship with them. Sport and storytelling can join forces to improve and enrich your
            social platform. You will have at hand exclusive content you will be able to use to fire the passion of your
            customers.
